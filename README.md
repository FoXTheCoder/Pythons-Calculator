# Welcome

Welcome to the Python Calculator repository! This project serves as an interactive and educational tool to learn the basics of Python programming while creating a simple command-line calculator application. Whether you're a beginner taking your first steps into the world of coding or an experienced programmer looking to refresh your skills, this repository provides a hands-on experience with fundamental Python concepts.

# Features:

- Basic Mathematical Operations: Explore addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations through an intuitive command-line interface.

- Error Handling: Learn about error handling by incorporating mechanisms to deal with invalid user inputs, ensuring the program doesn't crash unexpectedly.

- User Input Processing: Understand how to gather and process user input, converting it into numerical data that can be used in calculations.

- Functions: Familiarize yourself with the concept of functions by defining and utilizing separate functions for each mathematical operation.

- Looping: Experience how loops work by implementing a continuous loop that allows users to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program.

- Graceful Exit: Implement a graceful way to exit the program, teaching the importance of clean code execution.

- Conditional Statements: Learn about conditional statements by enabling users to choose different operations based on their input.

# How to Use:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command.

- Navigate to the project directory and run the calculator.py script using a Python interpreter.

- Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation, input numbers, and view the results of your calculations.

# Learning Objectives:

By engaging with this project, you'll gain practical experience in key Python programming concepts, including user input, functions, error handling, looping, and conditional statements. As you modify and extend the calculator's functionality, you'll solidify your understanding of these concepts and build a strong foundation for further Python exploration.
